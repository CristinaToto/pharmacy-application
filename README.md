This Java Pharmacy program is designed to manage medicine stocks, process orders, and provide basic pharmacy management functionality. 
It allows users to place orders, view available stock, add new medicines, and perform other basic pharmacy management tasks. 
The program uses object-oriented programming principles to create classes for medicines, pharmacies, and brand. 
The program can be used as a basic template for developing more complex pharmacy management systems or as a standalone tool for managing small pharmacies.
